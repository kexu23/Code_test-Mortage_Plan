# Code_test-Mortage_Plan
The application I built should calculate the monthly payments of the customers listed in the prospects.txt

This was my first time working this closely with maven so there were some issues at first due to an old version of Intellij not generating the correct files. Although it was a challenge to code this application I feel like I've gotten some experience of working with maven from it.

# How to Run
To run the .jar, make sure you have a Java version of at least 18.

To run the application, click on either mortage_csv_calculator.jar or mortage_csv_calculator_rounded_decimals.jar

The application will then ask you to input a file and the desired filetype is a csv file such as the prospects.txt that was provided.

Then the application will output each customers info and the monthly payment that they have to pay for their mortage.
